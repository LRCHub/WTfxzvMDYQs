We're running around
Loosing each other
Loosing ourselves
In our plans and our dreams
I would have thought you'll leave
But you stay here for me
Oh what a gift you are
Oh what a mess I am

We are held by the wild
We've grown a strong pair of wings
We forever deny
Any chains, any wheels
Please forgive me that I
Keep on trying to feel

That I'm drifting, I'm driving
To be who I am
Till the end

We're stumbling down
Eluding each other
And I'm foolish enough
To keep trusting the wind
You should have let me lead
From one side to another
But now it's time to quit
Oh please don't let me leave

We are held by the wild
We've grown a strong pair of wings
We forever deny
Any chains, any wheels
Please forgive me that I
Keep on trying to feel
That I'm drifting, I'm driving
To be who I am
Till the end

We fall
We stand up
Wild hearts
Go getters
We never know what's next
We always want the best
We fall
We stand up
Wild hearts
Go getters
We never know what's next
We always want the best

We forever deny
Any chains, any wheels
Please forgive me that I
Keep on trying to feel
That I'm drifting, I'm driving
To be who I am
Till the end
