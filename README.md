```
Yeah, that's karma, yeah, get down
(Ha-ooh)
Checkmate, I'm a superstar
Stay insane, but you rock with it, ah
Giga, TeddyLoid, yeah
Like 24/7, I'm a hot mess ya love-hate
Get less boring, oh, my god!
ホームラン バタバタ swing my shot, ooh, ooh, ah, yeah
Like a villainous villainess, bring home the jackpot
주인공과 악역의 차이는 없어 (ooh)
화려하게 놀아볼까? (Ba-ya-ya-ya)
Life's just a tightrope, why not stop to fool around?
"Chaotic good" is peak right now
I can show ya how (ba-ya-ya-ya)
Don't get confused, we are not the same
I'm a ruthless dame
No way, no way, way-ya, way-ya
"Good versus evil" is so overdone
Let's all kick back and party
Just leave it to moi
(Oops) wa-ah, loosen my lips
Loosen my li-li-lips, yeah, ah, that's karma
Ta-da-ha-ha-ha
(Whaps) wa-ah, loosen my lips
I'm about to say some ish, get it, yeah, that's karma
Ta-da-ha-ha-ha
Sorry, I'm just better
Sorry, we're go-getters
Ain't my fault we're wicked, stunning, tricky
Why you running? (Oh)
Bet 'cha think you're clever (ba-ya-ya-ya)
Whatever! (ba-ya-ya-ya)
Oh, talk about a "kumbaya" (ba-ya-ya-ya)
Hey, yo, check this out
전부 다 비켜줄래?
욕망을 다 흡수해
Love dollar heart, get down
우린 비밀 없이 니 lock을 풀어봐
(Boom, boom) 싸이코틱
(Boom, boom) 드라마틱
가십거리들에 미쳐
손가락질은 그만
Ayy, yo (ah-ah)
반전에 반전의 판을 뒤엎네
빠져들어 갖고 놀듯 아름답고 위험하게
모두 삼켜버릴 기세로 it's show time
자극적이게 go high
어릿광대들의 paradise
끌어당기는
유혹이 페어링을해
"Good versus evil, but I'm which one?"
Just stuck here in the middle, that's not any fun
Wa-ah, loosen my lips
Loosen my li-li-lips, yeah, ah, that's karma
Ta-da-ha-ha-ha
(Whaps) wa-ah, loosen my lips
I'm about to say some ish, get it, yeah, that's karma
Ta-da-ha-ha-ha
상상이 만드는
충동에서 오는
나를 감싸버린 어둠이 내 트리거 사인 (oh)
드러내 이 본능 (ba-ya-ya-ya)
울려 roars (ba-ya-ya-ya)
Oh, talk about a "Kumbaya", baya
Sorry, I'm just better
Sorry, we're go-getters
Ain't my fault we're wicked, stunning, tricky
Why you running? (Oh)
Bet 'cha think you're clever (ba-ya-ya-ya)
Whatever! (ba-ya-ya-ya)
Oh, talk about a "kumbaya"
Isekai queen
Switch チューニング マイナー
컬러풀한 cacophony (ba-ya-ya-ya)
삐딱하고 우아하게 안드로메다
Welcome to miss fortune's game
Ba-ya-ya-ya
Ba-ya-ya-ya
